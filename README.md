# Project7/Project9
Project from Paul Hudson series hackingwithswift.com

- Simple tableView project to look for whitehouse petitions. 

Functions added by myself:

   - Added Credits button which shows to whom the credits go to.

   - Added Search button which delivers case insensitive search through petitions.

   - Added Home Button which brings us back to start page after a search has been performed.
