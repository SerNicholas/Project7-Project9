# Project7
Project from Paul Hudson series hackingwithswift.com

- Simple tableView project to look for whitehouse petitions. 

Functions added by myself:

     - Added Credits button which shows to whom the credits go to.

     - Added Search button which delivers case insensitive search through petitions.

     - Added Home Button which brings us back to start page after a search has been performed.
